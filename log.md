# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Add first unit test for the app

**Thoughts**: Runing unit test on JavaScript is harder than I thought. When using `import` (I think it's babel syntax), there must be a babel/jest configuration before be able to run the test against `import`. Next time, look [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) at Babel section.
